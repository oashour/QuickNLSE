# nlse
Numerical Solutions for the nonlinear Schrodinger equation using CPU, CUDA and MPI.

Note: for compiling all these files you can use the compile script as follows:
./compile -c all -r all -o -p 1D
This compiles all 8 1 dimensional files, turns on optimizations (no CUDA runtime/CUFFT error checking and does not check for max |psi| every iteration, and runs all the files. Moreover, it also creates an extra MATLAB/GNU Octave script in $NLSE/1D that can be run to compare the execution time of all the different scripts (with a plot). This script is optimized for my system and might not work for other systems (requires CUDA 5.5 or higher, and a GPU with CUDA Compute Capability 3.0 or higher. Also requires having Open-MPI installed (built with fftw3 support), as well as fftw3. Make sure your $PATH and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables are set correctly. C code is compiled using gcc).

The remove script can be used to remove all the extra files generated by compiling and running the code (.vtk, .m, .out, etc.).
